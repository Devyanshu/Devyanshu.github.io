            <p>In January of 2019, I had the opportunity to teach advance concepts of Python under the Bennet Open
                Source Society(BOSS) with the aim of helping people to brush up their Python skills and encouraging them
                to contribute to <a class="post-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a>
                and take part in the upcoming <a class="post-link"
                    href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC'19</a>.</p>
            <p>
                The concepts were delivered as a six part series, each lasting two hours, taking place at Bennett
                University. The content was presented on <a class="post-link" href="https://notebooks.azure.com/">Azure
                    Notebooks</a>, so the participants can run each code in real
                time and not waste their
                time typing the code. The participants were asked to clone the Azure notebooks at the beginning of the
                session and edit the content as per their pleasing. The concepts that were covered included function
                decorators, some in-bulit libraries, generators, profiling, logging and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were exercises after each subtopic so that participants can practice what they learned then and
                their. After each session the participants were asked to submit the notebook that they were working on
                along with the solution to the exercises as a <a class="post-link"
                    href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull requests(PR)</a> on <a
                    class="post-link" href="https://github.com/BennettOSS/Advance_Python">Advance
                    Python repository</a>, this also made them used to <a class="post-link"
                    href="https://github.com">Github</a>,
                keeping in mind the BOSS side of things. The exercises were mainly small Python functions
                that replicated some in-bulit functions to build a
                core understanding of the concepts and how they were implemented by the developers. </p>
            <p>
                This series garnered appreciation from the participants and the faculties of CSE department of Bennett
                University and its head, Dr Deepak Garg.
            </p>

                Special thanks to Bennett Open Source Society for this opportunity and the experience and learning that
                came from it. Here are some of the photos of the sessions (Credits:BOSS).
