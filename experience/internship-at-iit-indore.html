        <p>In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a research intern at Indian Institute of
            Technology, Indore under the guidance of Dr. Somnath Dey, Assistant professor and the then acting head of
            Discipline of Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
        <p>Together with a fellow intern, my work included research on Masterprint and ways to prevent it and
            implementing
            an <a class="post-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417304360">algorithm
                for robust matching
                of partial fingerprints using minutiae and ridge shape features</a>.
            <p>
                After the initial research work, my first task was to familiarize myself with <a class="post-link"
                    href="https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/nist-biometric-image-software-nbis">NIST
                    Biometric Image Software (NBIS)</a> and process the <a class="post-link"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_Verification_Competition">FVC</a> databases with it.
                Afterwards, I created partial fingerprints using the FVC databases and running the Bozorth3 matching
                algorithm on it for benchmarking. This results would then be compared to the results of the to-be-made
                algorithm. A huge number of partial images were generated from the FVC database, therefore, an automated
                system was requred, it was achieved using Python, from <a class="post-link"
                    href="https://github.com/Devyanshu/image-split-with-overlap">generating the partial
                    fingerprints</a> to <a class="post-link"
                    href="https://github.com/Devyanshu/NBIS_python#run_bozorth3py">running
                    Bozorth3 algorithm</a> on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the reference result was collected, the work on the algorithm implementaion began, it was wrtten
                in
                MATLAB because of heavy image processing tasks and computation. After 3-4 weeks, the implementation was
                ready and it was run on the partial fingerprints and the results were colected for processing. The
                results compared on a small set of images showed promsing results. As of writing this post, the results
                are yet to be compared on the full database because of the computation time and size
                of the partial fingerprint database. Once the data is processed and compared, the
                results will be shown here.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was an amazing learning experience, both from academic and non-academic point of view. I learned
                MATLAB, got better in using Linux, learned a lot about fingerprints and biometrics in general and
                the importance of documentation. I also learned to work better in a team and to rebound from a
                bad day at work and make the next one better.
